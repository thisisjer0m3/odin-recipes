    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta that is a staple of
      Italian cuisine. It's made from durum wheat semolina and water. Often
      served with tomato sauce, meat, or vegetables, spaghetti is a versatile
      pasta shape. The name "spaghetti" comes from the Italian word "spago,"
      meaning "string," reflecting its long, thin shape.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti (about 200-250g for 2 servings)</li>
      <li>Olive oil (1-2 tablespoons for sautéing)</li>
      <li>Garlic (2-3 cloves, minced)</li>
      <li>Canned tomatoes (1 can, 400g, or fresh tomatoes if preferred)</li>
      <li>Tomato paste (1-2 tablespoons, optional for a richer sauce)</li>
      <li>
        Basil (fresh or dried, 1-2 teaspoons dried or a handful of fresh leaves)
      </li>
      <li>Oregano (1 teaspoon dried)</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)</li>
      <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
      <li>Sugar (a pinch, optional to balance acidity)</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese (grated, for topping)</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions (usually
        about 8-10 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the spaghetti and set aside, reserving a little pasta water for
        the sauce if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>
        Add the canned tomatoes (crushed or whole, which you can crush with a
        spoon) along with the tomato paste if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the dried oregano, basil, and a pinch of sugar (to balance the
        acidity of the tomatoes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the
        sauce thickens too much, you can add a little pasta water to reach your
        desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add red pepper flakes
        if you want a little heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the cooked spaghetti in the marinara sauce until well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it simmer together for a couple of minutes for the flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate the spaghetti, top with grated Parmesan cheese, and garnish with
        fresh parsley if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
