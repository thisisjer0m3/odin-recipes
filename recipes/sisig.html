      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Sisig is a popular Filipino dish known for its rich, savory, and smoky
        flavors. It is traditionally made from pig's head, including the ears,
        cheeks, and sometimes even the snout, which are boiled, chopped, and then
        grilled or fried. The dish is often served on a sizzling platter, which
        gives it a smoky aroma and a crispy texture.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pig's head (including ears, cheeks, and snout), chopped</li>
        <li>Onions, finely chopped</li>

        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Egg (optional, often added for creaminess)</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise (optional, for a creamy version)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Boil the pig's head (or other parts like pork belly or liver) until
          tender. This usually takes 1-2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grill or fry the boiled meat to achieve a crispy texture, then chop it
          into small pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Finely chop the onions and chili peppers.</li>
        <li>
          Mix the grilled and chopped meat with the onions and chili peppers in a
          bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season the mixture with soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Adjust to
          taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, crack an egg into the mixture while it's still hot, mixing
          it in for a creamy texture.
        </li>
        <li>If desired, add mayonnaise to the mixture for extra creaminess.</li>
        <li>
          Serve the sisig on a sizzling hot plate, and squeeze fresh calamansi or
          lemon juice over it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy the sisig with a side of rice or as an appetizer with cold drinks!
